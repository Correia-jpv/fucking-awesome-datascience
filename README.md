## What is Data Science?
**[`^        back to top        ^`](#awesome-data-science)**

Data Science is one of the hottest topics on the Computer and Internet farmland nowadays. People have gathered data from applications and systems until today and now is the time to analyze them. The next steps are producing suggestions from the data and creating predictions about the future. 🌎 [Here](www.quora.com/Data-Science/What-is-data-science) you can find the biggest question for **Data Science** and hundreds of answers from experts.

| 🌎 [What is Data Science @ O'reilly](www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-is-data-science) | _Data scientists combine entrepreneurship with patience, the willingness to build data products incrementally, the ability to explore, and the ability to iterate over a solution. They are inherently interdisciplinary. They can tackle all aspects of a problem, from initial data collection and data conditioning to drawing conclusions. They can think outside the box to come up with new ways to view the problem, or to work with very broadly defined problems: “here’s a lot of data, what can you make from it?”_ |
| 🌎 [What is Data Science @ Quora](www.quora.com/Data-Science/What-is-data-science) | Data Science is a combination of a number of aspects of Data such as Technology, Algorithm development, and data interference to study the data, analyse it, and find innovative solutions to difficult problems. Basically Data Science is all about Analysing data and driving for business growth by finding creative ways. |
| 🌎 [The sexiest job of 21st century](hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century) | _Data scientists today are akin to Wall Street “quants” of the 1980s and 1990s. In those days people with backgrounds in physics and math streamed to investment banks and hedge funds, where they could devise entirely new algorithms and data strategies. Then a variety of universities developed master’s programs in financial engineering, which churned out a second generation of talent that was more accessible to mainstream firms. The pattern was repeated later in the 1990s with search engineers, whose rarefied skills soon came to be taught in computer science programs._ |
| 🌎 [Wikipedia](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) | _Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data._ |
| 🌎 [How to Become a Data Scientist](www.mastersindatascience.org/careers/data-scientist/) | _Data scientists are big data wranglers, gathering and analyzing large sets of structured and unstructured data. A data scientist’s role combines computer science, statistics, and mathematics. They analyze, process, and model data then interpret the results to create actionable plans for companies and other organizations._ |
| 🌎 [a very short history of #datascience](www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/05/28/a-very-short-history-of-data-science/) | _The story of how data scientists became sexy is mostly the story of the coupling of the mature discipline of statistics with a very young one--computer science.  The term “Data Science” has emerged only recently to specifically designate a new profession that is expected to make sense of the vast stores of big data. But making sense of data has a long history and has been discussed by scientists, statisticians, librarians, computer scientists and others for years. The following timeline traces the evolution of the term “Data Science” and its use, attempts to define it, and related terms._ |
 🌎 [Software Development Resources for Data Scientists](www.rstudio.com/blog/software-development-resources-for-data-scientists/)|_Data scientists concentrate on making sense of data through exploratory analysis, statistics, and models. Software developers apply a separate set of knowledge with different tools. Although their focus may seem unrelated, data science teams can benefit from adopting software development best practices. Version control, automated testing, and other dev skills help create reproducible, production-ready code and tools._|
 🌎 [Data Scientist Roadmap](www.scaler.com/blog/how-to-become-a-data-scientist/)|_Data science is an excellent career choice in today’s data-driven world where approx 328.77 million terabytes of data are generated daily. And this number is only increasing day by day, which in turn increases the demand for skilled data scientists who can utilize this data to drive business growth._|
 🌎 [Navigating Your Path to Becoming a Data Scientist](www.appliedaicourse.com/blog/how-to-become-a-data-scientist/)|_Data science is one of the most in-demand careers today. With businesses increasingly relying on data to make decisions, the need for skilled data scientists has grown rapidly. Whether it’s tech companies, healthcare organizations, or even government institutions, data scientists play a crucial role in turning raw data into valuable insights. But how do you become a data scientist, especially if you’re just starting out? _|

## Where do I Start?
**[`^        back to top        ^`](#awesome-data-science)**

While not strictly necessary, having a programming language is a crucial skill to be effective as a data scientist. Currently, the most popular language is _Python_, closely followed by _R_. Python is a general-purpose scripting language that sees applications in a wide variety of fields. R is a domain-specific language for statistics, which contains a lot of common statistics tools out of the box.
 🌎 [Python](python.org/) is by far the most popular language in science, due in no small part to the ease at which it can be used and the vibrant ecosystem of user-generated packages. To install packages, there are two main methods: Pip (invoked as `pip install`), the package manager that comes bundled with Python, and 🌎 [Anaconda](www.anaconda.com) (invoked as `conda install`), a powerful package manager that can install packages for Python, R, and can download executables like Git. 

Unlike R, Python was not built from the ground up with data science in mind, but there are plenty of third party libraries to make up for this. A much more exhaustive list of packages can be found later in this document, but these four packages are a good set of choices to start your data science journey with: 🌎 [Scikit-Learn](scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) is a general-purpose data science package which implements the most popular algorithms - it also includes rich documentation, tutorials, and examples of the models it implements. Even if you prefer to write your own implementations, Scikit-Learn is a valuable reference to the nuts-and-bolts behind many of the common algorithms you'll find. With 🌎 [Pandas](pandas.pydata.org/), one can collect and analyze their data into a convenient table format. 🌎 [Numpy](numpy.org/) provides very fast tooling for mathematical operations, with a focus on vectors and matrices. 🌎 [Seaborn](seaborn.pydata.org/), itself based on the 🌎 [Matplotlib](matplotlib.org/) package, is a quick way to generate beautiful visualizations of your data, with many good defaults available out of the box, as well as a gallery showing how to produce many common visualizations of your data.

 When embarking on your journey to becoming a data scientist, the choice of language isn't particularly important, and both Python and R have their pros and cons. Pick a language you like, and check out one of the [Free courses](#free-courses) we've listed below!
